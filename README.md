# Open Ameba
Open Ameba RTL8710 SDK.

## Motivation
Trying to make some order in the mess around this SoC build system.
Most of the work is done by [@pvxx](https://github.com/pvvx) in his [RTL00MP3](https://github.com/pvvx/RTL00MP3) project.

## Getting Started
```
git clone https://github.com/drasko/open-ameba
cd open-ameba
make
```

Use verbose `make` for debugging:
```
make V=1
```

User preferences are set in `userset.mk`

Project preferences are set in `project.mk`
